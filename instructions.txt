Running the code is fairly simple, just download the java files and input files. 
When running the code, it will ask the location for the input files, just provide the correct location.
It will then ask for the location and name of an output file to output the brute force solution. 
After this is provided, it will ask for the location and name of output file for the random solution.
After the random output location and name is provided, it will ask for the location and name of the output file for the ga solution.
It will then respectfully print each solution to the respected text files.
Each run can only run one input file at a time, so to run all three input sets, the code needs to run three times.
When running the large input set, the code tends to take a few seconds to fully run.
